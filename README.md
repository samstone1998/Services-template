# Online Services Template
A responsive html and css template made using Bootstrap. This was one of my first templates designed using the framework so it will be interesting to see just how better my templates get over time.

## Technologies used:
  - HTML
  
  - CSS
  
  - Bootstrap
  
## What could be improved
When doing anything in life I believe there are improvements that can be made. Now looking back at this project( I am writing this section in the future) there is a lot of css inside the linked css file that could have been done using bootstrap making the project much cleaner.

I also now am not a fan of the design that I did. It looks clean but there feels like something is either missing or just not right. However I am still proud of this work as it shows the improvements that I have made over time and the way I look at designs have changed now that I have got more experience.


## Free for use
